State / Property = data stored in class or object.
there are classified into generic State and specific State

1️⃣ Generic State (Static / Class-level states)

These are common for all objects created from the class.

Stored in class memory.

Accessed using class name, not object name.

syntax----->>>> var_name = value   <<<<<<<---

2️⃣ Specific State (Non-static / Instance-level states)

These are specific to each object.

Stored in object memory (every object has its own copy).

Accessed using object reference.


syntax :- object_address.var_name = value

3️⃣ Constructor (__init__ method)

A special method that runs automatically when an object is created.

Used to initialize instance variables (object-specific states).

interview Questions :--- 
1) when will Constructor will executed ?
ans- when the obj is created

2) why we use Constructor ?
for initializing the instance variable and objects specific states


self ka obj ka address same hi rahega


4️⃣ Self Keyword

self parameter is a convention
self is a reference or hold to the current object/ address.

Used to access instance variables and methods inside the class.

Without self, Python won’t know which object’s data you mean.

when you define a method inside a class, you use self as the first parameter
allows you to access or manipulate the attributes of a methods of the instance

self is a special variable
self is always pointing to the current object address / current instances
