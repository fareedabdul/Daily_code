Oops is way of writing programs using objects - real world entities like car, student, employee, etc....

each object has :
Data : Stored in variables(called attributes)
Behavior : defined by functions(called methods)

python is an object oriented language, meaning almost everything in python is an object..

QUICK NOTE : OOPS makes programming like handling real world things, objects have their own data and actions, so code is cleaner and we can reuse and easier to manage and avoid repetitions..
