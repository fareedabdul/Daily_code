# print(dt | dt2)


# 11. Get the length of a collection.
# a = "string"
# print(len(a))

# 12 Modify the middle value of a given collection.
# a = "Hello mera Fareed"
# a = a[0:5] + " to" + a[10:]
# print(a)

# lst = [11,22,44,44,55]

# print(s + "love" + s1)

#16. Modify a character in the middle of a given string.
# a = "Hello mera Fareed"
# a = a[0:5] + " to" + a[10:]
# print(a)

#17. Modify the sequence of characters in a given string.
# s = "Python"
# # Reverse the sequence
# new_s = s[::-1]
# print(new_s)  # Output: "nohtyP"

#18.  Replace an old character with a new character in a given string.
# s = "Duck"
# s = "L" + s[1:]
# print(s)
