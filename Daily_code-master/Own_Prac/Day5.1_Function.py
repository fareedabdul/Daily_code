# def function(*names):
#     for name in names:
#         print("hi",name)
# function("Fareed","madhu","TXF")

# âœ… Final Master Formula to Remember:
# Type	Syntax	Packed into	Access Like
# Positional	*args	Tuple ((â€¦))	for i in args
# Keyword	**kwargs	Dict ({key: val})	for k,v in kwargs.items()

#      |__ 10, 20, 30 â†’ *args â†’ (10, 20, 30)
#      |__ name="Fareed", age=21 â†’ **kwargs â†’ {"name": "Fareed", "age": 21}
# âœ… Real-Life Analogy:
# You run a pizza shop:

# *args = Customer orders extra toppings (unlimited, just names)

# **kwargs = Customer gives extra info like size="large", sauce="spicy" (name + value)

# You donâ€™t know in advance what theyâ€™ll send â€“ but your function accepts it all.
