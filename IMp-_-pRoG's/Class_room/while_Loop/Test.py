# Write a Python program that takes input from the user for the type of food item they want (pizza or burger).
# If the item is pizza,
# Ask the user for the size (large, medium, small).
# Use nested ifâ€“else statements to check the size:
# If "large" â†’ print "Large Pizza â€“ Rs. 300"
# If "medium" â†’ print "Medium Pizza â€“ Rs. 200"
# If "small" â†’ print "Small Pizza â€“ Rs. 100"
# Any other input â†’ print "Invalid size"
# If the item is burger,
# Ask the user if they want cheese.
# Use nested ifâ€“else statements to check:
# If "yes" â†’ print "Cheese Burger â€“ Rs. 150"
# If "no" â†’ print "Regular Burger â€“ Rs. 100"
# If the item is neither pizza nor burger, print "Invalid item".
# ðŸ‘‰ Note: Use only ifâ€“else statements (no elif).
