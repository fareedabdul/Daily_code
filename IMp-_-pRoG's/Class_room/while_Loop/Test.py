# 1.PRINT THE SQUARES OF NUMBER FROM 1 TO 10 

# start = 1
# end = 10 
# while start <= end:
#     print(start ** 2)

#     start += 1

# 2. print all number divisible from 1 to 50 that are divisible by 7:


# start = 1
# end = 50

# while start <= end:
#     if start % 7 ==0:
#         print(start)
#     start += 1


# 3. print sum from 1 to 100 


# start = 1 
# end = 100 
# sum = 0

# while start <= 100:
#     sum += start 
#     start +=1 

# print(sum)


# 4. PRINT NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 100 BUT ONLY THOSE DIVISIBLE BY BOTH 3 AND 5 

# start = 1
# end = 100 

# while start <= end :
#     if start % 3 == 0 and start % 5 == 0:
#         print(start)
#     start += 1

# 5. by using single while loop print good morning / good afternoon / good evening 

# count = 1

# while count <= 15:
#     if count <= 5:
#         print("GM")
#     elif count <= 10:
#         print("GAF")
#     else:
#         print("GE")
#     count += 1
