# 1.PRINT THE SQUARES OF NUMBER FROM 1 TO 10 

# start = 1
# end = 10 
# while start <= end:
#     print(start ** 2)

#     start += 1

# 2. print all number divisible from 1 to 50 that are divisible by 7:


# start = 1
# end = 50

# while start <= end:
#     if start % 7 ==0:
#         print(start)
#     start += 1


# 3. print sum from 1 to 100 


# start = 1 
# end = 100 
# sum = 0

# while start <= 100:
#     sum += start 
#     start +=1 

# print(sum)


# 4. PRINT NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 100 BUT ONLY THOSE DIVISIBLE BY BOTH 3 AND 5 

# start = 1
# end = 100 

# while start <= end :
#     if start % 3 == 0 and start % 5 == 0:
#         print(start)
#     start += 1

# 5. by using single while loop print good morning / good afternoon / good evening 

# count = 1

# while count <= 15:
#     if count <= 5:
#         print("GM")
#     elif count <= 10:
#         print("GAF")
#     else:
#         print("GE")
#     count += 1

# Write a Python program that takes input from the user for the type of food item they want (pizza or burger).
# If the item is pizza,
# Ask the user for the size (large, medium, small).
# Use nested ifâ€“else statements to check the size:
# If "large" â†’ print "Large Pizza â€“ Rs. 300"
# If "medium" â†’ print "Medium Pizza â€“ Rs. 200"
# If "small" â†’ print "Small Pizza â€“ Rs. 100"
# Any other input â†’ print "Invalid size"
# If the item is burger,
# Ask the user if they want cheese.
# Use nested ifâ€“else statements to check:
# If "yes" â†’ print "Cheese Burger â€“ Rs. 150"
# If "no" â†’ print "Regular Burger â€“ Rs. 100"
# If the item is neither pizza nor burger, print "Invalid item".
# ðŸ‘‰ Note: Use only ifâ€“else statements (no elif).
